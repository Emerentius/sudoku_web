# Webassembly Sudoku solver

This is a fork of https://emerentius.github.io/sudoku_web/, which itself is adapted from attractivechaos's kudoku web solver: https://attractivechaos.github.io/plb/kudoku.html.

I wanted to test my own [Sudoku solver library][lib], which is slower than [emerentius's][emerentius], so prefer his to mine.
